# API and Resource Definitions

## BareMetalHost

The BareMetalHost resource defines the properties of a physical host
necessary to manage and provision it.

### Spec Fields

*bmc* -- The connection information for the BMC controller on the host.

*bmc.address* -- The URL for communicating with the BMC controller. When
communicating over IPMI, this should be a URL of the form
`ipmi://<host>:<port>` (an unadorned `<host>:<port>` is also accepted).
Specifying the port is optional; the default port is 623. Dell iDRAC is also
supported, by using the scheme `idrac://` (or `idrac+http://` to disable TLS)
in place of `https://` in the iDRAC URL; only the hostname or IP address is
required - `idrac://host.example` is equivalent to
`idrac+https://host.example:443/wsman`.

*bmc.credentials* -- A reference to a Secret containing the connection
data, at least username and password, for the BMC.

*online* -- A boolean indicating whether the host should be powered on
(true) or off (false). Changing this value will trigger a change in
power state on the physical host.

*machineRef* -- A reference to a Machine to which this host will be
attached when it is provisioned.

*image.url* -- The URL of an image to deploy to the host.

*image.checksum* -- An md5 checksum or URL to a file with a checksum
for the image at *image.url*.

*userData* -- A reference to the Secret containing the user data to be
passed to the host before it boots.

### Status Fields

*machineRef* -- The Machine tying this host to a Node.

*lastUpdated* -- The timestamp of the last time the status for the
host was updated.

*hardware* -- The details for hardware capabilities discovered on the
host. These are filled in by the provisioning agent when the host is
registered.

*hardware.nics* -- List of network interfaces for the host.

*hardware.nics.mac* -- The MAC address of the NIC.

*hardware.nics.ip* -- The IP address of the NIC, if one was assigned
when the discovery agent ran.

*hardware.storage* -- List of storage (disk, SSD, etc.) available to
the host.

*hardware.storage.size* -- Size in GB of the storage location.

*hardware.storage.info* -- Information string about the storage.

*hardware.cpus* -- List of CPUs in the system.

*hardware.cpus.type* -- The type of the CPU.

*hardware.cpus.speed* -- The speed in GHz of the CPU.

## Labels

The BareMetalHost operator manages several labels with host status and
settings to make it easier to find specific hosts.

*metalkube.org/hardware-profile* -- The name of the hardware profile
that matches the hardware discovered on the host. Details about the
hardware are saved to the *hardware* section of the status. If the
hardware does not match a known profile, the value "unknown" is used.

*metalkube.org/operational-status* -- The status of the server.

  *online* -- The server is powered on and running.

  *offline* -- The server is powered off.

  *error* -- There is an error with the configuration data for the
  host or there is a problem with the host itself. Refer to the
  *errorMessage* field in the status section for more details about
  the error condition.

## Triggering Provisioning

Several conditions must be met in order to initiate provisioning.

1. The host `spec.image.url` field must contain a URL for a valid
   image file that is visible from within the cluster and from the
   host receiving the image.
2. The host must have `online` set to `true` so that the operator will
   keep the host powered on.

To initiate deprovisioning, clear the image URL from the host spec.
